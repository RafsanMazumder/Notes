# System Design Basics
## Single Server Setup
![Single Server Setup](single_server_setup.drawio.svg)
1. User access websites through domain names, such as api.mysite.com. Usually the Domain 
Name System (DNS) is a paid service provided by 3rd parties and not hosted by our servers.
2. Internet Protocol (IP) address is returned to the browser or mobile app. In the example,
IP address 15.125.23.214 is returned.
3. Once the IP address is obtained, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are
sent directly to web server.
4.  The web server returns HTML pages or JSON response for rendering.
### Traffic Source for Web Server
The traffic to web server comes from two sources: web application and mobile application.<br />
1. Web Application: Uses a combination of server-side languages (Java, Python, etc.) to
handle business logic, storage, etc., and client-side languages (HTML and JavaScript) for
presentation.
2. Mobile Application: HTTP protocol is the communication protocol between the mobile
app and the web server. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is commonly used API
response format to transfer data due to its simplicity. An example of the API response in
JSON format is shown below:<br /><br />
GET /users/12 â€“ Retrieve user object for id = 12
```json
{
    "id": 12,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "address": {
        "streetAdress": "21 2nd Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": 10021
    },
    "phoneNumbers": [
        "212 555-1234",
        "646 555-4567"
    ]
}
```
